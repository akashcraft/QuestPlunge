## About
This is a fun little game consisting of six different levels with varying difficulty, mood, puzzles, and challenges. Quest Plunge revolves around the main character called Ethan The Hero.
Join the quest to explore the world in Ethan's eyes and defeat the boss in the final level. I hope you enjoy it. Quest Plunge was originally created for a Computer Project in one of my engineering courses.

## Timeline

This project was completed over a period of 3 months with all document deliverables as required by the
				course
				outline.
				It is
				sometimes interesting to look back at your creation and retrospect. In my case, it all began with those YouTube Unity Tutorials and the mighty white block!
